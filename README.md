## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• ¬°Welcome to my Personal Portfolio!
This project serves as my personal portfolio, crafted using one of my favourite technologies ‚Äî **Vue 3**, powered by the **Nuxt 3** framework.  
It showcases my experience in front-end development, responsive design, routing logic, API integration, and dynamic theming, including both light and dark modes. I also share some of my past experiences in various projects, covering both front-end and back-end development.
